This is a http-server written in go.
After going through go basics, and working on backend development projects in my college days in flask 3 years back, it is time to come back and polish my skillsets.

Always had something for networking concepts, backend development and how things actually works under the hood.
Therefore, writing this go server from scratch, without http module initially, to get an understanding of go concepts and how things work under the hood actually in these layers.

Currently in the profile of DevOps, Infra or Platform, I can already see getting better grasp of what's happening in the abstraction and helping me become not just a better developer which I always wanted, but a better debugger which is what my current profile requires.
